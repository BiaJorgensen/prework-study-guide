        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML describes the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element is the only user visible element in the head element. It names the tab of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements nested in other elements are called Child Elements.</li>
          <li>Child elements are nested in Parents Elements.</li>
          <li>Element is everything in between opening and closing tags.</li>
          <li>Tag is only what is in between the angle brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> CSS is used to make webpage more user friendly, by adding colors, aligning text, and other styles.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>External CSS file sheet is preferred because it keeps rules separate from HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS file styles an element directly on the HTML file and should only be used for quick and permanent changes.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet adds CSS rules directly in HTML head element and applies only to that particular page.</li>
          <li>It is best practice to separate code into different files based on use, this is called Separation of Concerns.</li>
          <li>Avoid repeating rules, when possible, combine 2 or more selectors (using comma) when creating a rule. DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself!</li>
          <li>Create Class Attributes as selectors (i.e.: .card) to add styles to certain elements, not all.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Never edit directly from the main branch</li>
          <li>Git command must proceed every Git statement.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout branch name: moves working branch to another branch.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Always use 'git pull original main' (change "main" to the branch name you are branching from) to pull most recent version of branch. This way you will not be working from an outdated code version.</li>
